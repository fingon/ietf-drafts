    <section title="This solution compared to doing this in DHCPv6/NDP [RFC
                    Editor: please remove]">

      <t>The angle of attack of the MIF work to date (autumn 2015) has been
      to add container options and their transfer mechanisms to DHCPv6 and
      NDP. This document details a different approach, and therefore it is
      sensible to compare it to to the existing solutions in terms of
      (highly subjective) pros and cons.

      The authors consider pros of this proposal to be:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>No overhead for hosts that do not care (possibly most; no
        spurious RA options, ...)</t>

        <t>No problems with relaying data; if the first-hop device does not
        care, DNS request propagate onward.</t>

        <t>Little/no changes to DHCP, DHCPv6, DHCPv6-PD or RA.</t>

        <t>No duplication of specifications / TLVs for DHCP, DHCPv6 and
        RA.</t>

        <t>Solves m:n prefix &lt;-&gt; PVD elegantly: no need to either
        duplicate applying prefix for each PVD or duplicate each PVD for
        each applying prefix.</t>

        <t>Easily extensible (TXT records, no TLV definitions, parsing and
        generation necessary)</t>

        <t>Probably not affected by IPR on draft-ietf-mif-mpvd-dhcp-support</t>

        <t>Reuses the existing reverse DNS infrastructure</t>
      </list>

      The authors consider cons of this proposal to be:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>This scheme requires DNS servers ‘close’ on the path to the
        user, if changed information is to be sent; otherwise centralized
        solution would work (with some synthesized records).</t>

        <t>Security using either DNSSec or in-band hashes is rather painful
        (but possibly not more than the scheme in the current DHCP/RA
        drafts), so the default would most likely be insecure. That is not
        much different from DHCP*/RA, which are also 99.999…% of the time
        not secured.</t>

      </list>

      </t>

    </section>
 
    <section title="Discussion Points [RFC Editor: please remove]">
    	<t>
    	<list style="symbols">
    	<t>Besides special purpose prefixes, it might be desirable to
    	have special purpose routers which only provide access to certain
    	services but not the entire internet. These services could be
    	announced by only using more-specific routes, however if the
    	destination addresses are possibly changing, extension of the RIO
    	mechanism might be needed. One possibility would be to add a new
    	RIO S-flag with semantics like: "When the host receives
    	a Route Information Option with the S-Bit set, it MUST ignore the value
    	in the Prf-field (even if it is (10)) and instead assume the preference
    	to have a value greater than (11). However, it MUST only use the route
    	for packets having a source prefix announced by the same router.". This
    	would allow selective routes (Prf=(10)) only applying to MIF-hosts.</t>
    	
        <t>DNSSEC delegation of reverse zones might be difficult in some cases.
        It is debatable, whether we want a complementary in-band signing
        mechanism as well, e.g., pre-shared public keys associated the domain
        name of the TXT records and "sig-X=..." record tags (where X identifies
        the specific key) and ... is an EdDSA or ECDSA signature over all
        records not starting with "sig-". Care would need to be taken wrt. TTL
        and negative caching though.</t>
